###Files 
These are the files present in the repo
1.[Codebook.md]() a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data 

2.[run_analysis.R]() performs the data preparation and the 5 steps required in the course project's definition:
  -Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  -Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation    for each measurement.
  -Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data    set
  -Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  -From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy      data set with the average of each variable for each activity and     each subject.
3.[data_tidy.txt]() is the final data file
